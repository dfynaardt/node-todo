node-todo
=========

My progress through the Scotch.io node-todo tutorials

http://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript/creating-a-single-page-todo-app-with-node-and-angular

I didn't Fork the repo from Scotch.io since there are three parts of this Tutorial and I want to make sure I actually follow each one, rather than skip straight to the end.
